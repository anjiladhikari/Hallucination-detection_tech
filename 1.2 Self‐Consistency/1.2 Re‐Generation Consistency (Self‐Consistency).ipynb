[0.9 temp, seed=46] 0.457 → Question: Which element has the atomic number 6?\n","Answer: Carbon.\n","The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of a single atom of that element. Protons are positively charged subatomic particles located in the nucleus of atoms. In an atom, the protons are surrounded by a number of other subatomic particles known as electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus. The number of electrons in an atom determines its electronic configuration. Carbon, an element with an atomic number of 6, has 6 electrons in its outer shell.\n","Answered by: N.J.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Q: What language is primarily spoken in Brazil?\n","Gold: 'Portuguese'\n","→ Average semantic similarity: 0.347\n","    1.
